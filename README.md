# Using Visual Analytics to Reduce Churn

The  technology  advance  and  the  use  of  data  for  decision-making drive business and increase competitiveness among companies.They  must  understand  the  environment  in  which  they  operate,  andquickly respond to the needs of their customers, preventing them fromcanceling their services, maximizing profit, and benefit their own orga-nizations.  The  main  goal  of  this  work  is  to  present  a  visual  analytics approach  to  deal  with  a  large  amount  of  unstructured,  complex,  anddynamic data and improve companies’ ability to detect the probabilityof losing a customer at an early stage. We processed the probability ofsubscription cancellation using the machine learning algorithm RandomForest and we allowed similar customers comparison using the k-nearestneighbor’s algorithm. Then, we developed two main visualizations: a gen-eral dashboard that displays the probability of subscription cancellationof each client and the variables that can influence this decision; and aradar chart that displays many quantitative variables and allows compar-ison with other similar customers. To validate our approach we presenta case study with a data set from a hosting services company that usesthe Platform as a Service (PaaS) model. Through the application of in-formal interviews, we concluded that the visualizations available in ourapproach helped teams in the process of reducing churn rate and there-fore maintaining a growing customer base’s company. They allowed theanalysis  and  information  understanding  to  create  strategies  and  makeassertive decisions for professionals involved in the retention process.
